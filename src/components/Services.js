          <p>
              I have worked on front-end projects ranging from static pages
              to full flesh responsive web applications. My main front-end 
              tools are React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. But I can easily adapt 
              and use other tools when necessary. This website is a proof of
              my work.

              I have worked in teams where we developed APIs based on backend 
              tools like Spring, SQL. I also worked on mini personal projects 
              based on Nodejs and mongodb, React and Firbase. So I have experience
              working on both SQL and NoSQL databases
