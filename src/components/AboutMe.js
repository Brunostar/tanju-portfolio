          Tanjuate Brunostar Achaleke is my very long name. Most people call me
          Brunostar or Bruno and some Tanju. I am passionate about solving everyday
          problems (both simple and complex) using tech. So I spend a lot of my time
          learning new technologies, experimenting with personal projects and helping
          other who may need it.

          I have had the opportunity to attend tech boot camps and internships. These
          helped me get rid of my imposter syndrom as I got to work on Software projects
          in a team where we built highly scalable Industry ready applications using 
          agile methodology. Working in teams i realized is so fun as everyone is allowed
          to express themselves in comfortable environments. The flow of ideas and suggestions
          just makes the work seamless. check out my github for some of these projects
          and also connect with me on LinkedIn, email or WhatsApp.
