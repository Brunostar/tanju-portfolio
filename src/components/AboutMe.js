          Tanjuate Brunostar Achaleke is my very long name. Most people call me
          Brunostar or Bruno and some Tanju. I study Software Engineering at the
          the University of Bamenda, Cameroon. This was expected as I have had 
          a passsion for technology for as Long as I can remember. So after high
          school. I did not have two things in mind.

          I am currently in my fourth Year and i thought to myself, "You have been
          studying and working on Software ever since you got to the University.
          Why not set up a portfolio website and show case your work perhaps someone
          could give you a job or at least a paid internship". Here we go. Find below a
          sample of my work.
